## Changes

Instance data is now recorded when a boss is killed, allowing you to award items outside an instance and still have accurate history data. The recorded instance is attached to sessions, and is only used for a maximum of 30 mins after a kill. Note that entering a new instance before starting the session will cause it to use the new instances' data.

It persists through reloads and is also reset when testing.

## Bugfixes

- *Improved transmission of settings for people joining the raid late.*
- *Fixed issue with importing csv data with quotes in notes.*
- *Loot history data is now again sorted properly by award time.*
- *Clearing the loot history now only deletes entries from the current characters' faction-realm storage instead of everything recorded.*
